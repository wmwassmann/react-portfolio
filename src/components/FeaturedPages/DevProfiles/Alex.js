                <p2>
                    Alex contributed his extensive front-end skills and enthusiasm to RPG: Adventurer's academy. 
                    His greatest strength lies in his ability to visualize and conceptualize a project's aesthetic in story-board fashion. 
                    He will go above and beyond frequently working late hours bring that vision to life through front-end 
                    JavaScript and from-scratch CSS.
