                <p2>
                    David is a force of nature with JavaScript and CSS. He has shown me that no problem is too difficult and can be solved through patience, 
                    resilience, and a logical approach. When presented with a challenge, David is the first to take initiative in learning language or method to get the job done. 
                    It was his innovation with CSS animation (specifically dice rolling) that inspired me to learn how to animate this very page.
