               <p2>Karl has proven himself to be a valuable think tank in the collaborative process. In developing the RPG: Adventurer's Academy, He and I bounced numerous ideas off of one another to bring the project to life. His backend skills are equally fantastic, working with MySQL databases and Passport for authentication for user login systems.</p2>
