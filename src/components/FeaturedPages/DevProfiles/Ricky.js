                <p2>If our group ran into a bug, Ricky had an answer. Even if it took dozens of trial and error runs no problem was too difficult for Ricky. His sheer work ethic, logical process, and resourcefulness with JavaScript inspired us to press on through the most difficult of times. Along with phenomial JavaScript skills, he is an expert in back-end applications such as MongoDB, Sequelize, and Handlebars. </p2>
